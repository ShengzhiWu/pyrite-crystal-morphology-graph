# pyrite-crystal-morphology-graph

This project provides a vivid interactive visualization of pyrite crystal forms.

Pyrite is renowned for its aesthetic appeal and diverse macroscopic crystal structures. Under varying conditions, it can form cubes, octahedrons, pyritohedrons (pentagonal dodecahedrons), and intermediate morphologies.

Studies have shown a significant correlation between pyrite morphology and gold content, making the identification of pyrite crystal forms highly valuable for practical applications.
